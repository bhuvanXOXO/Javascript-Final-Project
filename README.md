<--- COMMENTS --->

In index.js file, line 198 to be commented and and 199 uncommented in its placeâ€“ for the p5 sketch to visualise data taking api tweet count data as a parameter. Before node.js server starts, the code runs into a problem otherwise because the variable containing the data is still null.
